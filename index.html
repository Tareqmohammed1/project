                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence, or AI as we call it, is simply an attempt to make computers think and act like humans. What does that mean? It means when you open Google and type "restaurants near me" and it understands you and shows you the results you want, that's artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>This isn't new at all - it started around the 1950s, but now it's everywhere. From Siri on iPhone, to Netflix when it suggests movies, to YouTube when it selects videos you might like. All of this is artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>The basic idea is that the system learns from the data we feed it. The more data it sees, the more accurate and smarter it becomes. Like a small child learning from experience, but much faster.</p>

                <h3>The Fundamental Components That Artificial Intelligence Relies On :</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> This is the part that makes the system learn on its own without us explicitly programming it. Like when Netflix learns from the movies you've watched and suggests similar content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> This is what makes computers understand human speech. When you talk to Siri or Google Assistant, that's what's happening.</li>
                    <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> The system's ability to understand images and videos. Like when Facebook recognizes you in photos, or when the camera on your phone recognizes faces.</li>
                    <li><strong>Robotics:</strong> This is the integration of artificial intelligence with physical devices. Like robots working in factories, or those used in surgical procedures.</li>

                <div class="intro-text">
                    <p>Artificial Intelligence isn't a new idea at all. It all started in 1950 when a scientist named Alan Turing asked a simple question: "Can machines think?" And that was the beginning of everything.</p>
                    <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, people were very excited and thought that within 20 years we'd find smart robots in every home. But reality was much harder. Technology at that time was limited, and data was scarce.</p>
                    <p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the field entered a period called "AI Winter" - meaning funding decreased and interest waned. People began to lose hope.</p>
                    <p>But in the 1990s and 2000s, the internet and big data came in, and the field came back strong. Now artificial intelligence is everywhere, and every day there are new discoveries.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Why is Artificial Intelligence So Important ?</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">
                Artificial Intelligence isn't just a new technology, it's a new way of thinking about solving problems. From speed and accuracy, to the ability to continuously learn, artificial intelligence offers solutions to problems we used to solve manually.
            </p>
            <div class="benefits-grid">
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h3>Speed and Accuracy</h3>
                    <p>Imagine you need to analyze a million medical images to find tumors. A human might take months, but artificial intelligence can do it in hours. And it's not just speed, it's accuracy too. The system doesn't get tired or distracted like humans.</p>
                    <p>In banks, for example, artificial intelligence detects suspicious transactions in seconds. If a human were to do it, it would take a very long time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h3>It Learns on Its Own</h3>
                    <p>The fundamental difference between regular programs and artificial intelligence is that AI improves over time. The more data it sees, the more accurate it becomes.</p>
                    <p>For example, when you use Google Translate, the more people use it, the more accurate the translation becomes. The system learns from mistakes and improves.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h3>Handles Boring Tasks</h3>
                    <p>In every job there are boring and repetitive tasks. Artificial intelligence can do them for you, and you can focus on the important things that require human thinking.</p>
                    <p>For example, in companies, artificial intelligence handles responses to simple customer messages, which allows employees to focus on complex problems.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="benefit-card">
                    <h3>Helps You Make Better Decisions</h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence analyzes huge amounts of data and reveals patterns you wouldn't notice on your own. This helps you make decisions based on more information.</p>
                    <p>For example, in e-commerce, the system understands customer behavior and suggests products that might sell more. This makes business decisions more accurate.</p>

                            <li><strong>Understanding Customers:</strong> Companies use artificial intelligence to understand their customers' behavior. The system analyzes previous purchases and suggests new products. This significantly increases sales.</li>
                            <li><strong>Smart Marketing:</strong> Instead of sending ads to everyone, artificial intelligence helps you reach the right audience. The system understands what each person is interested in and presents them with appropriate ads.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inventory Management:</strong> The system understands which products sell more and when you need to reorder. This prevents companies from keeping too many unused products, which saves money.</li>
                            <li><strong>24/7 Customer Service:</strong> Most companies now have robots that answer customer questions. The system understands the question and answers immediately. If the question is complex, it transfers to a human employee.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Large companies now use artificial intelligence in every decision. From choosing new products, to setting prices, to selecting employees.</p>

                    <p>You might not realize it, but artificial intelligence is everywhere around you. When you open Facebook and it shows you posts you might like, that's artificial intelligence. When you use Netflix and it suggests movies, that's artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>Even on your phone, when you type a message and the keyboard suggests words you want to type, that's artificial intelligence. When the camera recognizes faces in photos, that's artificial intelligence.</p>
                    <p>In e-commerce, when Amazon suggests products to you, that's artificial intelligence. The system understands what you've bought before and suggests similar items.</p>
                    <p>Even in banks, when you transfer money and the system detects something suspicious about the transaction, that's artificial intelligence. The system understands suspicious patterns and protects you from fraud.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges and Drawbacks</h2>
            <div class="challenges-content">
                <p>Artificial intelligence is amazing, but not everything is rosy. There are real challenges we face:</p>
                <ul class="challenges-list">
                    <li>
                        <strong>Very High Cost:</strong> Developing strong artificial intelligence systems requires huge investments. Small companies might not be able to afford the cost. This makes the technology available only to large companies initially.
                        <span class="challenge-note">But over time, costs decrease. Now there are free tools available to everyone.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Privacy Issues:</strong> For artificial intelligence to work, it needs a lot of data. This makes people worried about their privacy. Companies collect information about you to improve their services.
                        <span class="challenge-note">There are new laws like GDPR in Europe that protect people's privacy, but there's still more work to do.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Jobs Disappearing:</strong> Artificial intelligence is now doing things that humans used to do. This makes some jobs disappear. Employees in factories and stores face the risk of replacement.
                        <span class="challenge-note">But at the same time, new jobs are emerging. The important thing is for people to learn new skills.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Over-Dependence on Technology:</strong> When we depend too much on artificial intelligence, we might forget basic skills. If the system fails, we could be in big trouble.
                        <span class="challenge-note">The important thing is to use technology as an assistant, not as a complete replacement.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bias in Data:</strong> Artificial intelligence learns from the data we feed it. If the data contains bias, the system will be biased too. This is a big problem in hiring and loans, for example.
                        <span class="challenge-note">Developers are now doing a lot of work to ensure systems are fair.</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Difficulty Understanding:</strong> Some artificial intelligence systems are very complex and it's not clear how they reach their conclusions. This makes it difficult to trust them in important decisions.
                        <span class="challenge-note">There's a lot of research now to make systems more transparent.</span>
                    </li>
